Date: `r format(Sys.Date(), format="%B %d %Y")`

### Rules of usage

Every directory should have:  
1. start.R file sourcing all auxillary functions and packages. It should also set a proper working directory.    
2. readme.md with more or less brief explanation.  

### Final decision

Disappointed with my inability to stick with my own rules, workspace management and so on, I decided to cease the work in this repo.
