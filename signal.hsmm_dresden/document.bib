  abstract = {Motivation: Computational prediction of signal peptides is of great
	importance in computational biology. In addition to the general secretory
	pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts possess another
	major pathway that utilizes the Twin-Arginine translocase (Tat),
	which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal peptides carrying
	a distinctive pattern of two consecutive Arginines ({RR}) in the
	n-region. A major functional differentiation between the Sec and
	Tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates
	secreted proteins unfolded through a protein-conducting channel,
	whereas the latter translocates completely folded proteins using
	an unknown mechanism. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel
	method for predicting and discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides
	at better accuracy. Results: We report the development of a novel
	method, {PRED}-{TAT}, which is capable of discriminating Sec from
	Tat signal peptides and predicting their cleavage sites. The method
	is based on Hidden Markov Models and possesses a modular architecture
	suitable for both Sec and Tat signal peptides. On an independent
	test set of experimentally verified Tat signal peptides, {PRED}-{TAT}
	clearly outperforms the previously proposed methods {TatP} and {TATFIND},
	whereas, when evaluated as a Sec signal peptide predictor compares
	favorably to top-scoring predictors such as {SignalP} and Phobius.
	The method is freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/{PRED}-{TAT}/.

	of most secreted proteins and many integral membrane proteins in
	both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Consequently, accurate prediction
	of signal peptides and their cleavage sites is an important task
	in molecular biology. In the present study, firstly, we develop a
	novel discriminative scoring method for classifying proteins with
	or without signal peptides. This method successfully captured the
	characteristics of signal peptides and non-signal peptides by integrating
	hydrophobicity alignment and positionspecific amino acid propensities
	based on the highest average positions. As a result, this method
	is capable of discriminating proteins with signal peptides at the
	overall accuracies of 96.3\%, 97.0\% and 97.2\% by leave-one-out
	jackknife tests on the constructed benchmark datasets for three different

	Secondly, we consider the prediction task of signal peptide cleavage
	sites as a sequence labeling problem and apply Conditional Random
	Fields ({CRFs}) algorithm to solve it. Experimental results demonstrate
	that the proposed {CRFs}-based cleavage site finding approach can
	achieve the prediction success rates of 80.8\%, 89.4\%, and 74.0\%

	misleading results if {ROC} curves cross. However, the {AUC} also
	has a much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to

	incoherent in terms of misclassification costs: the {AUC} uses different
	misclassification cost distributions for different classifiers. This

	as serious as misclassifying a class 0 point, but, using another
	classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is P times as serious,

	have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region

	the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series
	of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length
	were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of
	the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In
	each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3
	positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues
	are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from
	3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage
	regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently
	processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter,
	with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long
	cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage
	region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing
	reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The
	results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase
	active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the

  abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and
	signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic
	regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading
	to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve
	predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor
	that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology
	information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide
	leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus
	of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the
	membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein
	topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on
	a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) that models the different sequence
	regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane
	protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on
	a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to {TMHMM} and {SignalP},
	errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments
	and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False
	classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\%
	and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from
	19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens
	and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false
	classifications compared to {TMHMM}/{SignalP}, suggesting that Phobius
	is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and
	transmembrane regions. The method is available at as well as at},

	Reporter molecules such as gaussia and vargula luciferase or secreted

	different signal peptides during our study. In this way, the secretion
	efficiency of the recombinant antibody has been analyzed by transient
	expression experiments in {CHO} cell lines. Compared to the control
	signal peptide, it was not possible to achieve higher efficiencies
	with signal peptides derived from a variety of species or even natural
	immunoglobulin G signal peptides. The best results were obtained
	with natural signal peptides derived from human albumin and human
	azurocidin. These results were confirmed by fed-batch experiments
	with stably transfected cell pools, in which cell-specific productivities
	up to 90 pg cell(-1) day(-1) and product concentrations up to 4 g

	Reduction in either the net positive charge or the hydrophobicity
	of the {DeltaEspP} signal peptide decreased the effectiveness of

	Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane
	submodel. We introduce a two-stage {DBN} decoder that combines the
	power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style

	confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions.
	We report a relative improvement of 13\% over Phobius in full-topology
	prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity
	and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We also show
	that our confidence metrics correlate well with the observed precision.

	provides an overall picture of the relative numbers of proteins that

  abstract = {Several papers have been published where nonlinear machine learning
	algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines
	and decision trees, have been used to model the specificity of the
	{HIV}-1 protease and extract specificity rules. We show that the
	dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is
	a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem.
	The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier
	like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine,
	and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models.
	We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved
	by the {HIV}-1 protease and list the most prominent rules, relating
	them to experimental results for the {HIV}-1 protease. {MOTIVATION}:
	Understanding {HIV}-1 protease specificity is important when designing
	{HIV} inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms
	have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been
	made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly
	complex models have been used. {RESULTS}: We show that the problem
	is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear
	classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines
	are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also
	show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting
	linear classifiers. {AVAILABILITY}: The datasets used are available

  abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their
	proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have
	become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells
	for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however,
	the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly
	and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent
	protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in
	the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and
	critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting
	signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant,
	animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences,
	respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists
	of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following
	three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein
	as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by
	fusing many individual {OET}-{KNN} (optimized evidence-theoretic
	K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of
	{PseAA} (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set
	of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a
	query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm;
	(3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence
	alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through
	a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction
	rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful
	for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available
	as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/

	Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that
	do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain
	terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided
	in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft

	Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter

	Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other

  abstract = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and
	are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical
	potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider
	must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use.
	It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective
	proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature
	peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly
	from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing,
	the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted
	bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies
	(support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree)
	and developed an algorithm ({SpiderP}) for prediction of propeptide
	cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector
	machine ({SVM}) framework that combines both local and global sequence
	information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools
	for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation
	of the {SVM} method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences
	yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced
	five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from
	the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test
	the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\%
	8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology
	information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins
	from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes,
	which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution
	of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool ({SpiderP}) is freely

  abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides ({SP}) and their

	approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided
	into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order
	to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism
	for {SP} cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting
	{SP} cleavage sites called Signal-{CTF} that utilizes machine learning
	and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins
	in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus,
	bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-{CTF} consists of three distinct
	elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with
	a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of
	possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein;
	(2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning
	the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned
	candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best
	candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting
	system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site
	among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different
	width. When compared with Signal-3L and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors,
	the prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 4‚Äì12‚Äâ\%, 10‚Äì25‚Äâ\% higher
	than that of Signal-3L for human, animal and eukaryote, and {SignalP}
	4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria,
	respectively. Comparing with {PRED}-{SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors
	on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos‚Äôs paper, the
	prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 12.5‚Äâ\%, 25‚Äâ\% higher than
	that of {PRED}-{SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0, respectively. The predicting
	results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-{CTF}
	can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than {SignalP},
	Phobius, Philius, {SPOCTOPUS}, Signal-{CF} and Signal-3L. These results
	show that Signal-{CTF} is more accurate and flexible in predicting
	signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.
